alias: Viomi S9 - job complete and device error notifications
description: >-
  Forward notifications from the Viomi S9 vacuum. Note the use of helper
  variable input_text.viomi_s9_script_helper to store the type of the last job
  performed. V2 uses the MihomeMessageSensor entity for triggering notifications
  which appears to be quicker and more accurate. Also note that because this
  entity and the other S9 entities are updated at different times, do not
  reference any of the other S9 entities here as the state may not be correct.
  E.g. when this sensor triggers for error conditions, the entity
  sensor.viomi_v18_155a_device_fault may not be updated with the error details
  yet. As such we will need our own translation of the error codes (which may
  not be a bad thing since the original messages in the system is pretty basic
  and cryptic).
